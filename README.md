## 👤 About Me

***Bridging medicine & AI to deliver clinically-informed digital health solutions***

I am a clinically trained medical professional (MBBS) transitioning into healthcare technology through an MSc in Computer Science with AI. I specialise in **clinically-informed software development**, combining Python, AI/ML, NLP, and data analytics to build tools that are **technically robust and medically interpretable**.

My goal is to develop, validate, and deploy intelligent healthcare solutions that **improve patient outcomes, streamline clinical workflows, and integrate predictive decision support** into real-world clinical settings. 

My focus areas include **data science, digital health product management, AI/ML in medicine, and health informatics**.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🧠🤖 AI Symptom Checker
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/SimonYip22/AI-Symptom-Checker) | [Live API](https://ai-symptom-checker-5rfb.onrender.com)

A **Python-based AI symptom checker** combining **rule-based inference** with **clinically-informed logic** to interpret patient-reported symptoms and rank likely conditions.  

Unlike generic AI tools, this project encodes **doctor-level clinical reasoning**, using weighted symptom–condition mappings and input normalisation to reflect real-world prioritisation.  

**Highlights:**
- 🏥 Clinically-informed input handling for lay-language symptoms  
- ⚖️ Rule-based inference with **formula-weighted scoring** ensuring interpretable, relevant outputs  
- 💻 Dual interface: **Command-line tool** + **FastAPI JSON API (live on Render)**  
- 🔄 **Continuous Integration (GitHub Actions)** validates API endpoints weekly and on push  
- 🧩 Modular architecture, future-ready for **ML/NLP integration and frontend expansion**  

**Workflow Overview:**

### 🩺 📈 Vitals Tracker CLI
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/SimonYip22/Vitals-Tracker-CLI)  

A **Python-based CLI tool** for **multi-patient vitals monitoring**, **real-time NEWS2 scoring**, tiered clinical alerts, and trend visualisation (ASCII & Matplotlib). Designed with **clinically-informed logic**, GDPR-compliant patient management, and longitudinal tracking.

**Highlights:**
- Full vitals capture: BP, HR, RR, Temp, O₂ sats, Level of Consciousness  
- Tiered alerts aligned with **clinical decision thresholds** (Normal → Mild → Moderate → Severe)  
- Patient ID anonymisation for GDPR-compliant multi-patient tracking  
- Portfolio-ready visualisations for trends and alerts  
- Modular architecture supporting **future AI/ML predictive extensions**  

**Workflow Overview:**
