## 👤 About Me

***Bridging medicine & AI to deliver clinically-informed digital health solutions***

I am a clinically trained medical professional (MBBS) transitioning into healthcare technology through an MSc in Computer Science with AI. I specialise in **clinically-informed software development**, combining Python, AI/ML, NLP, and data analytics to build tools that are **technically robust and medically interpretable**.

My goal is to develop, validate, and deploy intelligent healthcare solutions that **improve patient outcomes, streamline clinical workflows, and integrate predictive decision support** into real-world clinical settings. 

My focus areas include **data science, digital health product management, AI/ML in medicine, and health informatics**.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🧠🤖 AI Symptom Checker
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/SimonYip22/AI-Symptom-Checker)  

A **Python CLI tool** leveraging **clinically-informed rule-based AI** to interpret patient symptoms and rank potential conditions. Unlike generic AI tools, the system encodes **clinician-level symptom-to-condition mappings**, producing outputs that are **interpretable, relevant, and clinically meaningful**.  

**Highlights:**
- Clinically-informed input handling for lay-language symptoms  
- Rule-based inference with **formula-weighted scoring** reflecting real-world prioritisation  
- Structured CLI workflow emulating **clinical reasoning steps**  
- Modular, testable architecture enabling **future AI/ML and front-end integration**  

**Workflow Overview:**

### 🩺 📈 Vitals Tracker CLI
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/SimonYip22/Vitals-Tracker-CLI)  

A **Python-based CLI tool** for **multi-patient vitals monitoring**, **real-time NEWS2 scoring**, tiered clinical alerts, and trend visualisation (ASCII & Matplotlib). Designed with **clinically-informed logic**, GDPR-compliant patient management, and longitudinal tracking.

**Highlights:**
- Full vitals capture: BP, HR, RR, Temp, O₂ sats, Level of Consciousness  
- Tiered alerts aligned with **clinical decision thresholds** (Normal → Mild → Moderate → Severe)  
- Patient ID anonymisation for GDPR-compliant multi-patient tracking  
- Portfolio-ready visualisations for trends and alerts  
- Modular architecture supporting **future AI/ML predictive extensions**  

**Workflow Overview:**
