# Hi, Iâ€™m Simon â€” MBBS | MSc Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence ðŸ‘‹

Bridging medicine & AI to deliver **clinically-informed digital health solutions**.

---

## About Me

I am a clinically trained medical professional (MBBS) transitioning into healthcare technology through an MSc in Computer Science with AI. I specialise in **clinically-informed software development**, combining Python, AI/ML, NLP, and data analytics to build tools that are **both technically robust and medically interpretable**.

**My goal**: to develop, validate, and deploy intelligent healthcare solutions that **improve patient outcomes, streamline clinical workflows, and integrate predictive decision support** into real-world clinical settings, to advance healthcare innovation in areas including data science, digital health product management, AI/ML in medicine and health informatics.

## Featured Projects

### AI Symptom Checker
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/SimonYip22/AI-Symptom-Checker)  
Python CLI tool that leverages **clinically-informed rule-based AI** to interpret patient symptoms and rank potential conditions. Unlike generic AI, the system encodes **clinician-level symptom-to-condition mappings**, producing outputs that are **interpretable, relevant, and clinically meaningful**.

**Highlights:**
- Clinically-informed input handling for lay-language symptoms  
- Rule-based inference with **formula-weighted scoring** reflecting real-world prioritisation  
- Structured CLI workflow emulating clinical reasoning  
- Modular, testable architecture for future AI/ML and front-end integration

### Vitals Tracker CLI
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/SimonYip22/Vitals-Tracker-CLI)  
A **Python-based CLI tool** for multi-patient vitals monitoring with **real-time NEWS2 scoring**, tiered clinical alerts, and trend visualisation (ASCII & Matplotlib). Designed using **clinical logic**, data privacy, and structured patient monitoring principles.

**Highlights:**
- Full vitals capture: BP, HR, RR, Temp, Oâ‚‚ sats, level of consciousness  
- Tiered alerts reflecting **clinical decision thresholds** (Normal â†’ Mild â†’ Moderate â†’ Severe)  
- Patient ID anonymisation for GDPR-compliant longitudinal tracking  
- Portfolio-ready visualisations showing trends and alerts  
- Modular architecture supporting AI/ML predictive extensions

### Future Projects
- **Intelligent Clinical Decision Support Tool (CDST):** AI/ML-powered tool for predictive risk stratification  
- **EWS Expansion:** Full Early Warning Score system integrating predictive analytics  
- **NLP Clinical Findings Extraction:** Automating insight extraction from unstructured clinical notes
