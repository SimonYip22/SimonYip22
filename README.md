## 🎖️ Featured Projects

### 🫀📉 NEWS2 Vitals Tracker with Alerts, Monitoring & visualisation (CLI & FastAPI)
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/SimonYip22/Vitals-Tracker-CLI) | [Live API](https://vitals-tracker-cli.onrender.com/docs)

A **Python-based CLI & FastAPI tool** for **multi-patient vitals monitoring**, **real-time NEWS2 scoring**, tiered clinical alerts, and trend visualisation (ASCII & Matplotlib). Designed with **clinically-informed logic**, GDPR-compliant patient management, and longitudinal tracking.  

Supports clinicians in real-time monitoring, reduces risk of missed deterioration, and can integrate into hospital EHRs.

**Highlights:**
- 🏥 Clinically-informed input handling for patient vitals with validation  
- 📊 **Full vitals capture**: BP, HR, RR, Temp, O₂ sats, Level of Consciousness  
- 🚨 Tiered NEWS2 scoring and alerts aligned with **clinical decision thresholds** (Normal → Mild → Moderate → Severe)
- 💻 **Dual interface**: **Command-line tool** + **FastAPI JSON API (live on Render)** 
- ❓ Patient ID anonymisation for GDPR-compliant longitudinal multi-patient tracking
- 🔄 **Continuous Integration (GitHub Actions)** validates API endpoints weekly and on push
- 📈 Portfolio-ready trend visualisation with ASCII charts and **Matplotlib plots**  
- 🧩 Modular architecture supporting **future AI/ML predictive extensions**  

**Workflow Overview:**

### 🧠🤖 Rule-Based AI Symptom Checker (CLI & FastAPI)
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/SimonYip22/AI-Symptom-Checker) | [Live API](https://ai-symptom-checker-5rfb.onrender.com)

A **Python-based, rule-driven AI symptom checker** that leverages clinical reasoning to interpret patient-reported symptoms and rank potential conditions. Users can interact via a **command-line interface (CLI)** or a **FastAPI-based JSON API (v2)**, making the tool both scriptable and deployable for web integration.

Unlike generic AI tools, this project encodes **doctor-level clinical reasoning**, where condition-symptom mappings, input normalisation and formula-weighted scoring reflect real-world clinical prioritisation.

**Highlights:**
- 🏥 Clinically-informed input handling for lay-language symptoms  
- ⚖️ Rule-based inference with **formula-weighted scoring** ensuring interpretable, relevant outputs  
- 💻 **Dual interface**: **Command-line tool** + **FastAPI JSON API (live on Render)**  
- 🔄 **Continuous Integration (GitHub Actions)** validates API endpoints weekly and on push  
- 🧩 Modular architecture, future-ready for **ML/NLP integration and frontend expansion**  

**Workflow Overview:**
